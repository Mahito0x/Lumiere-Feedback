## <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tarikul-Islam-Anik/Animated-Fluent-Emojis/master/Emojis/Symbols/Red%20Question%20Mark.png" alt="Red Question Mark" width="25" height="25" /> Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>üîí Is Lumi√®re open-source?</strong></summary>
<br>

**No.** Lumi√®re is a closed-source project. This decision allows us to:
- Maintain high security standards
- Protect intellectual property
- Ensure code quality and consistency
- Prevent malicious forks or misuse
- Focus resources on features, not support for self-hosters

We believe in transparency through community engagement, not code access.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>üè† Can I self-host Lumi√®re?</strong></summary>
<br>

**No.** Lumi√®re is only available as a **hosted service**. This ensures:
- Consistent performance across all servers
- Guaranteed uptime and reliability
- Automatic updates and security patches
- Unified feature set for all users
- Professional support and maintenance

Self-hosting would fragment the user experience and create support nightmares. We're committed to providing the best possible service through our hosted infrastructure.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>üé® Can I request features specific to my server?</strong></summary>
<br>

**Sort of.** You're welcome to suggest anything, but keep in mind:
- Features must benefit the **broader Discord community**
- Server-specific customizations aren't feasible at scale
- General-purpose features with wide appeal get priority
- We can't accommodate every niche use case

If your idea solves a problem many servers face, we'd love to hear it!

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>üîÆ Will Lumi√®re ever become open-source?</strong></summary>
<br>

**No plans currently.** Our focus is on:
- Delivering exceptional features
- Maintaining security and stability
- Growing the community
- Providing world-class support

Going open-source would fundamentally change our development model and isn't aligned with our current vision. We prefer to stay laser-focused on building the best bot possible.
