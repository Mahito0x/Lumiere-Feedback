## 📋 Submission Guidelines

### 🐞 Bug Reports — Best Practices

**Before you submit:**

- [ ] Search existing issues to avoid duplicates
- [ ] Verify the bug is consistently reproducible
- [ ] Ensure you're using the latest bot version
- [ ] Gather relevant screenshots or logs

**Perfect bug report structure:**
```
🔴 ISSUE: Brief, descriptive title

📝 DESCRIPTION:
Clear explanation of what's broken

🔄 REPRODUCTION STEPS:
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Bug occurs

✅ EXPECTED: What should happen
❌ ACTUAL: What actually happens

📸 EVIDENCE: [Screenshots/logs here]
🔧 CONTEXT: Server size, permissions, bot config
```

> [!WARNING]  
> **Never** include sensitive data like tokens, API keys, passwords, or personal information in public issues. For security vulnerabilities, DM a moderator in our [Support Server](https://discord.gg/xEnqxessd7).

### 💡 Feature Requests — What We Look For

**Great requests answer these questions:**

1. **Problem Statement** — What pain point does this solve?
2. **Target Audience** — Who needs this and why?
3. **Proposed Solution** — How do you envision it working?
4. **Alternatives Considered** — What other approaches exist?
5. **Additional Context** — Any examples, mockups, or references?

> [!TIP]
> Features that align with Lumière's core mission (moderation, community management, server automation) have the highest chance of implementation. Think scalability and broad appeal!

### 🔧 Enhancement Suggestions — Making Good Better

**When proposing improvements:**

- **Be specific** — Vague suggestions are hard to implement
- **Explain the why** — Help us understand the value
- **Consider edge cases** — Think about different server sizes/types
- **Provide examples** — Real scenarios make your case stronger

**Template:**
```
Current Behavior: [How it works now]
Proposed Improvement: [What you want changed]
Benefits: [Why this makes Lumière better]
Impact: [Who this helps and how]
```

- **Accurate** — Verify information before submitting
- **User-friendly** — Think from a beginner's perspective

**Documentation types we need:**
- Command guides and examples

<details>
<summary><strong>🔒 Is Lumière open-source?</strong></summary>
<br>

**No.** Lumière is a closed-source project. This decision allows us to:
- Maintain high security standards
- Protect intellectual property
- Ensure code quality and consistency
- Prevent malicious forks or misuse
- Focus resources on features, not support for self-hosters

We believe in transparency through community engagement, not code access.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🏠 Can I self-host Lumière?</strong></summary>
<br>

**No.** Lumière is only available as a **hosted service**. This ensures:
- Consistent performance across all servers
- Guaranteed uptime and reliability
- Automatic updates and security patches
- Unified feature set for all users
- Professional support and maintenance

Self-hosting would fragment the user experience and create support nightmares. We're committed to providing the best possible service through our hosted infrastructure.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🎨 Can I request features specific to my server?</strong></summary>
<br>

**Sort of.** You're welcome to suggest anything, but keep in mind:
- Features must benefit the **broader Discord community**
- Server-specific customizations aren't feasible at scale
- General-purpose features with wide appeal get priority
- We can't accommodate every niche use case

If your idea solves a problem many servers face, we'd love to hear it!

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🔮 Will Lumière ever become open-source?</strong></summary>
<br>

**No plans currently.** Our focus is on:
- Delivering exceptional features
- Maintaining security and stability
- Growing the community
- Providing world-class support

Going open-source would fundamentally change our development model and isn't aligned with our current vision. We prefer to stay laser-focused on building the best bot possible.
